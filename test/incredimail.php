<h4>Trouble with IncrediMail Sign In</h4>
You're trying to sign in to IncrediMail and you have forgotten your IncrediMail login—your password, or even your user ID. What you can do? Here is the good-news, bad-news situation: if you did your   IncrediMail   sign up correctly, you have two easy ways: on your IncrediMail page, just click “I can't access my account.” This will bring you to a simple page that gives you options for resetting your password or for remembering your user name. That's the good news.
<p>Here's the bad news: when you set up your IncrediMail sign in, you were asked to set up secret questions, password hints, and an alternative email address to use, and other information. What were these for? For situations where you forget your password! So you will be asked these secret questions and alternate email address information, and so long as you have the correct answers IncrediMail will let you reset your password.
<p>What if you have not created these up yet? Then this is the right time to do this. They are found in your Account Settings in IncrediMail if you haven't done so, you should go set these immediately, because if you haven't, getting your password reset again is nearly impossible!
Trouble with bogus IncrediMail emails
