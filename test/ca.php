<h4>CA Anti-Virus Plus</h4>
is software for both home & office PC users. It does not include a firewall but It works together with the Windows firewall itself. It can be used for removing spyware as well as malware in any form such as viruses, worms, rootkits, Trojan Horses. 

There may be so many reasons to use antivirus software. Spyware steals personal information and sometime switch your home page and re-direct to some other sites. Spyware can also record every keystroke that you make so that it can steal passwords. Worms also use email to spread themselves. When someone opens the attachment from an email, some of the virus also comes along with the attachment which then creates harm to the computer. More harmful worms carry a payload and can delete files from the target system or install a path to capture the PC into a network that the worm’s creator controls. These networks can be known as a group of hackers, and they trace the IP address and then they have a control of the system. With so many threats supposed to be seems, the only solution for that is CA antivirus.
 

<h4>Features</h4>
CA Antivirus Plus is fast and light. It installs easily. Before installing it does a quick scan prior to installation. It automatically scans USB drives upon insertion. The product continuously updates itself. You can monitor the status of the system with reports that show user activity and system alerts. This antivirus software integrates with search engines to help block malware. In order to maintain a current list of virus signatures, this security software updates itself automatically. However, if the antivirus software has never seen a particular file before, it can’t match it with a known threat. To protect against new virus outbreaks that haven’t made it into the list of known malware, this product also scans files and compares them to known families of viruses and analyses file behaviour in order to ascertain threat. This type of threat detection is based on a set of rules that allow the software to identify a new variant of a virus whose behaviour matches a virus from a known threat family.
