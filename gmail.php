<h4>Trouble with Gmail! Sign In</h4>
You are trying to sign in to Gmail and you have forgotten your Gmail email login—your password, or even your user ID. What you can do? Here is the good-news, bad-news situation: if you did your Yahoo email sign up correctly, you have two easy ways: on your Gmail page, just click “I cannot access my account.” This will bring you to a simple page that gives you options for resetting your password or for remembering your user name. That is the good news.
Here is the bad news: when you set up your Gmail email sign in, you were asked to set up secret questions, password hints, and an alternative email address to use, and other information. What were these for? For situations
Where you forget your password! So you will be asked these secret questions and alternate email address information, and so long as you have the correct answers Gmail will let you reset your password.
What if you have not created these up yet? Then this is the right time to do this. They are found in your Account Settings in Gmail if you havennot done so, you should go set these immediately, because if you havenot, getting your password reset again is nearly impossible!
<h4>Trouble with bogus Gmail emails</h4>
