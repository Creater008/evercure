<h4>Microsoft Office Outlook</h4>
shines as an email client with great talent for organizing (virtual folders, fast search), solid spam and phishing filters, and seamless integration with to-do lists and scheduling.
Outlook's message templates could be more flexible, though, and its smart folders could learn from example.


<h4>Pros</h4>
<li>Outlook comes with solid and effective spam filtering and blocks phishing attempts
<li> Snappy, flexible search, virtual folders, conversations and mail grouping help you organize mail
<li> Outlook integrates email messages, to-do lists, scheduling and social networking updates well


<h4>Cons</h4>
<li> Outlook is a bit confusing to set up and can be confusing to use with its myriad of options
<li> You cannot create smart folders, flags or rules that learn by example
 <li>Outlook lacks useful message templates, and its RSS feed reader flexibility

<h4>Description</h4>
<li>Microsoft Office Outlook manages multiple POP, IMAP, Exchange, MSN and Hotmail accounts.
<li>Outlook offers powerful filters and ways to organize, thread, label and find messages.
<li> Effective junk mail and phishing filters move unsolicited messages to a "Junk E-mail" folder automatically.
<li> Outlook offers "Search Folders", which automatically contain all items matching certain criteria.
<li> Searching for any message in any folder or account is pleasantly fast and sufficiently powerful in Outlook.
<li>Outlook supports S/MIME email encryption and IRM access control (e.g. mail can't be forwarded).
<li> To protect your privacy, Outlook doesn't download remote images and can display all mail in plain text.
<li>Outlook attachment preview lets you view many types of attached files right inside the message.

<h4>Most of the times people face the problem with configuring the e- mail accounts with Microsoft outlook .</h4>
As part of its Trustworthy Computing initiative, Microsoft took corrective steps to fix Outlook's reputation in Office Outlook 2003. Among the most publicized security features are that Office Outlook 2003 does not automatically load images in HTML emails or permit opening executable attachments by default, and includes a built-in Junk Mail filter.[23] Service Pack 2 has augmented these features and adds an anti-phishing filter.

Microsoft Outlook Express
</h1><img src="./images/outlook_express.png">
Outlook Express was an email client, newsgroup client, and contact management software application that Microsoft bundled with Internet Explorer 4, 5 and 6 and all versions of Microsoft Windows from Windows 98 to Windows Server 2003. Other than the similar name there is no connection between the two products and they originated from different divisions of Microsoft. While both offer access to POP3 and IMAP4 email accounts, only Outlook offers client access (MAPI) to Microsoft Exchange. Outlook Express was succeeded by Windows Mail and subsequently byWindows Live Mail.
<br><br><h4>
<u>Basic troubleshooting of outlook is simple but sometimes it actually conflicts with the type of servers such as :-
</h4>
</u>
<li>POP3 -  Post Office Protocol
<li>Http  - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol 
<li>or Ftp -  File transfer Protocol
<br>
<br><br>
<li>Some times you may face a problem in which the outlook window opens and then immediately closes and you  get an error box  "Cannot start Microsoft office outlook. Cannot open the Outlook window."
<br><br><li>Sometimes you get the  toolbar on outlook says it is working offline.
So these are some of the cases in which you can only be fixed by a Microsoft certified technician who have the license and certificate to work on this software and as well as they are the experts in these kind of troubleshooting .
