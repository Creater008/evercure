<h4>Trouble with Yahoo! Mail Sign In</h4>
You are trying to sign in to Yahoo! Mail and you have forgotten your Yahoo email login—your password, or even your user ID. What you can do? Here is the good-news, bad-news situation: if you did your Yahoo email sign up correctly, you have two easy ways: on your Yahoo! Mail page, just click “I can't access my account.” This will bring you to a simple page that gives you options for resetting your password or for remembering your user name. That's the good news.
Here is the bad news: when you set up your Yahoo email sign in, you were asked to set up secret questions, password hints, and an alternative email address to use, and other information. What were these for? For situations where you forget your password! So you will be asked these secret questions and alternate email address information, and so long as you have the correct answers Yahoo! Mail will let you reset your password.
What if you have not created these up yet? Then this is the right time to do this. They are found in your Account Settings in Yahoo! If you haven't done so, you should go set these immediately, because if you haven't, getting your password reset again is nearly impossible!
Trouble with bogus Yahoo Mail emails
All of a sudden your email box is full of messages, and they say that a message you tried to send someone failed but you didn't send them any such message! You may have been hit by viruses that has hacked your password on your Yahoo! account. There are several ways to protect against this, including:
<li> Make sure to use a any difficult password, so that any unknown person cannot be able to guess it easily (You can create password which is a combination of letters, words, any symbol)
<li> Make sure to change your Yahoo password regularly
<li> Make sure you have excellent anti-virus and anti spyware / malwares software installed on your system and also make sure that they are up-to-date
